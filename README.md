# Patrimonium Editor for Fercan
Project-specific adaptation of https://patrimonium.huma-num.fr/atlas/editor/

## Introduction

This document serves as a guide for users and developers involved in customising the Patrimonium Editor specifically for the Fercan project. The Fercan project, which focuses on the study of Celtic divine names in ancient inscriptions, uses the Patrimonium Editor to manage and analyse epigraphic data. This document outlines the scope of the customisation, introduces the project, and details the integration and extensions made to the Patrimonium Editor to meet the specific needs of the project.

The Fercan project is supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) through grants P 29274-G25 and P 34422 G. It aims to explore Celtic divine names in the Roman provinces of Germania Inferior and Germania Superior, with a focus on understanding cultural interactions and religious dynamics during the Roman period. The research examines how local Celtic traditions were integrated into Roman practices, using epigraphic evidence to trace changes and continuities in religious expression.

## Customisation of the Patrimonium editor

The primary aim of customising the Patrimonium Editor is to enhance its ability to support the specific needs of the Fercan project.

## Patrimonium Editor

The Patrimonium Editor is an integrated suite of web applications tailored for academic and research use, focusing on the encoding, management and analysis of epigraphic and historical textual sources. Prior to customisation, it included an XML editor for accurate text encoding, text conversion tools that adhere to the Leiden Conventions, and data management capabilities for handling information about places, people, and thematic categories relevant to historical texts. It is designed to support a wide range of epigraphic documentation needs and is suitable for a variety of academic and research environments.

Its modular architecture not only provides considerable flexibility in terms of customisation, but also leverages the robust power of the eXist-db XML database. Structured to work with the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) and EpiDoc (Epigraphic Documents) guidelines, the editor provides a robust framework for document encoding and data representation. This basic design allows it to be adapted to the specific needs of different research projects, ensuring that the Patrimonium Editor remains a versatile tool for scholars in the digital humanities.

### Core Components

**1.AusoHNum library:**.
- Functionality: Serves as the base library that provides backend functionality. It contains a collection of XQuery functions, JavaScript scripts and CSS stylesheets that enable and enhance the functionality of the front-end application and data repository.
- Content: This library contains reusable modules that handle various tasks such as data retrieval, transformation, presentation and interaction within the web application framework.

**2. Front-end application: eStudium**.
- Interface: The primary user interface where the actual interaction with the coded texts and datasets takes place. It is the main web application of eXist-db.
- Customisation: Provides project-specific settings such as customisation of TEI elements and templates, making it adaptable to the specific needs of different historical projects.
- Editor interface: Includes an easy-to-use XML editor that provides users with tools for encoding, editing, and wrapping text with XML elements in a visually accessible interface.

**3. Data repository: eStudiumData**.
- Data repository: Acts as a back-end application where all project-related data is stored. This includes TEI-coded texts, records of places and people, and thesaurus schemas.
- Management: Ensures data integrity and retrievability. It is optimised for efficient querying and manipulation of the XML data that is central to the function of the Patrimonium Editor.

### Functional Overview

**Text Editor**
- XML encoding: The text editor panel allows easy creation and editing of XML files, facilitating epigraphic text encoding by wrapping selected text with the necessary XML tags.
- Tools: Includes a number of additional editing tools such as search and replace, validation and formatting options to assist users in creating valid and well-structured TEI documents..

**Places Manager:**
- **Spatial Data**: Supports the creation and curation of spatial entities. It is designed to interact with place data models such as Pleiades and other ontologies that help connect, organise and relate spatial information.
- **Integration**: Links places to texts and other datasets within the Patrimonium framework, enabling multi-dimensional analysis of epigraphic data.

**People Manager:**
- **Prosopographical Data**: Manages the creation and curation of person-related data, using models such as SNAP:DRGN to describe historical figures, their attributes, and their relationships to one another.
- **Linkage**: Ensures that individuals mentioned in texts are accurately documented and linked, providing a comprehensive prosopographical dataset.

**Thesaurus Management:**
- **Controlled Vocabulary**: Handles thesaurus systems which provide controlled vocabularies for subjects, objects, and terms used within historical texts.
- **Standardization**: Aims to standardize the terminology used across documents, facilitating consistent tagging and easier retrieval of related texts.

**Zotero Integration:**
- **Bibliographic Data**: The editor integrates with Zotero, allowing users to manage references and bibliographic data directly within the application.
- **Synchronization**: Ensures that citations and sources are kept up-to-date and are easily accessible during the research and documentation process.

### Technical Infrastructure & Data Models

- **eXist-db**: A NoSQL XML database at the core of the Patrimonium Editor, responsible for storing, indexing, and querying XML data.
- **XML Standards**: Compliance with TEI and EpiDoc standards for encoding texts, ensuring that data conforms to internationally recognized guidelines in digital humanities.
- **Web Application**: The editor is accessible through a web browser, reducing the need for local installation and allowing for collaborative work across different locations.

**Data Models:**
- **Places Documents**: Based on Pleiades and NeoGeo spatial ontologies, enriched with connections described in SKOS and Dublin Core.
- **People Documents**: Modeled after Pleiades Place and SNAP:DRGN standards, also utilizing SKOS and Dublin Core for describing and relating individuals in historical texts.

### Libraries and Applications

#### AusoHNum Library
