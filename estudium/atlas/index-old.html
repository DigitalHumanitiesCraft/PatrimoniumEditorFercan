                    </div>
                    <p>The main obstacle for any research on the imperial properties is our current
                        fragmentary knowledge of the sources due to the serious deficit of dedicated
                        studies in the last century. In order to solve this problem in the best
                        possible way, the first objective of PATRIMONIVM is the creation of the
                        <strong>Atlas patrimonii</strong>, a relational database where all relevant evidence for the
                        study of the imperial properties will be stored.</p>

                    <p>The database will feature four main tables, containing respectively records
                        for textual sources (literary, papyrological and epigraphic), places (with
                        geolocalization), people (from peasants to procurators and freedmen in
                        general), and bibliographic references. The records of the different tables
                        will be linked and cross-searchable according to a number of criteria. This
                        powerful and versatile tool will finally allow us to manage all the pieces
                        of relevant information scattered over a massive number of publications. The
                        database will not simply contain raw data: translations, historical
                        commentaries and bibliographic references will be provided for every textual
                        source, while the descriptions attached to the different geographical
                        entities will include topographic and archaeological informations. The
                        prosopography will include all attested imperial slaves and freedmen as well
                        as all persons working in connection with the imperial properties
                        (administrations, tenants, contractors etc.).</p>

                    <p>The database will make use of EpiDoc, SNAP and of other XML-based open
                        frameworks to digitally present the texts and handle a large amount of
                        prosopographical data, textual annotations, citations, bibliographic
                        references and geodata. This will allow for an unprecedented degree of
                        interoperability with other online repositories. The inclusion of geodata
                        will permit innovative ways of visualizing the geographic distribution of
                        properties and people as well as mapping economic connections and human
                        mobility in connection with the patrimonium Caesaris.</p>

                    <p>The database will be put online by the end of 2019. This will allow the
                        researchers taking part to the planned series of workshops to take advantage
                        of this tool. The database will be completed for the end of the fifth year
                        and updated with newly published data even after the conclusion of the
                        project. It will stand as a lasting result of PATRIMONIVM.</p>
