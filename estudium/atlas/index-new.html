                        <p>The main obstacle for a research on imperial properties
                            at the scale of the entire Roman empire is the current
                            fragmentary knowledge of the sources. This is due to a
                            deficit of general studies in the last century and to
                            the continuous discovery of new epigraphic and
                            papyrological sources. In order to solve this problem in
                            the best possible way, the PATRIMONIVM project has
                            created the <strong>
                        <em>Atlas patrimonii Caesaris
                                (APC)</em>
                    </strong>, a relational database where
                            all relevant evidence for the study of the imperial
                            properties is stored. Information on the more or less
                            precise localisation of the imperial properties has been
                            extracted from the evidence and represented in a
                            cartographic way.</p>
                        
                        <p>
                    <em>APC</em> features five main components. Three are
                            dedicated respectively to records for textual sources
                            (literary, papyrological and epigraphic), places
                            (document provenances, imperial estates, patrimonial
                            districts, etc.), people (from peasants to procurators
                            and freedmen in general). The remaining two contain the
                            bibliographic references and the vocabulary (thesaurus)
                            used in the database. The records of the different
                            tables are linked and cross-searchable according to a
                            number of criteria. This powerful and versatile tool
                            finally allows us to manage all the pieces of relevant
                            information scattered over a massive number of
                            publications.</p>
                        
                        <p>
                    <em>APC</em> is a large database with thousands of
                            documents, places and people records and <strong>still remains
                                under construction and development</strong>. While most of the
                            sources for the reconstruction of the geography of
                            imperial properties are already included, <strong>new documents
                                are still added regularly, and modifications can be introduced into existing ones</strong>. In this firs version, <em>APC</em> should be mainly seen as a supporting tool for the forthcoming publications on the history of imperial properties in the Roman world and not yet as an independent publication. In the long term, the
                            database will not simply contain raw data: translations,
                            historical commentaries and bibliographic references
                            will be provided for every textual source, while
                            descriptions attached to the different geographical
                            entities will include topographic and archaeological
                            informations. The prosopography will include all
                            attested imperial slaves and freedmen as well as all
                            persons working in connection with the imperial
                            properties (administrations, tenants, contractors
                            etc.). <em>APC</em> is just starting, and this living project still has a long way to go!</p>

                    <em>APC</em> has been constructed following <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/                         " target="_blank">FAIR principles</a> and is
                            using the Exist-db environment. APC has been built on Linked Open Data principles and aims at a large interoperability with other online databases and services. <strong>APC is still under development, links to Trismegistos, Pleiades and other projects are still very incomplete</strong>.</p>
                        <p>
                    <strong>Planned features</strong>: data as XML, complex and full-text search tools, more interactive maps (including with timeline)</p>
                        
                        <p>APC also includes the PATRIMONIVM
                            Editor, a innovative tool for creating and annotating
                            Epidoc documents with an easy to use interface that
                            significantly reduces the learning curve needed to
                            produce digital editions of epigraphic texts.</p>
